# Node BBS Signatures

![Master](https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures/workflows/push-master/badge.svg)

This repository is the home to a performant multi-message digital signature algorithm which supports deriving zero knowledge proofs that enable selectively disclose from the originally signed message set.

BBS+ Signatures are a digital signature algorithm originally born from the work on [Short group signatures](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~xb/crypto04a/groupsigs.pdf) by Boneh, Boyen, and Shachum which was later improved on in [Constant-Size Dynamic k-TAA](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~wzhang/teach-552/ReadingList/552-14.pdf) as BBS+ and touched on again in section 4.3 in [Anonymous Attestation Using the Strong Diffie Hellman Assumption Revisited ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306347781_Anonymous_Attestation_Using_the_Strong_Diffie_Hellman_Assumption_Revisited).

BBS+ signatures require a [pairing-friendly curve](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03), this library includes
support for [BLS12-381](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03#section-2.4).

BBS+ Signatures allow for multi-message signing whilst producing a single output signature. With a BBS signature, a [proof of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge) can be produced where only some of the originally signed messages are revealed at the discretion of the prover.

## Getting Started

To use this package within your project simply run

```
npm install @mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures
```

Or with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```
yarn add @mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures
```

## Usage

The following is a short sample on how to use the API

```typescript
import { generateBls12381KeyPair, sign, verify, createProof, verifyProof } from "@mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures";

//Generate a new key pair
const keyPair = generateBls12381KeyPair();

//Set of messages we wish to sign
const messages = [ "message1", "message2" ];

//Create the signature
const signature = sign({
    secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,
    domainSeparationTag: "domain",
    messages: messages,
});

//Verify the signature
const isVerified = verify({
    publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    domainSeparationTag: "domain",
    messages: messages,
    signature
});

//Derive a proof from the signature revealing the first message
const proof = createProof({
    signature,
    publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    messages,
    nonce: "nonce",
    domainSeparationTag: "domain",
    revealed: [0],
});

//Verify the created proof
const isProofVerified = verifyProof({
    proof,
    publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    messageCount: messages.length,
    messages,
    nonce: "nonce",
    domainSeparationTag: "domain",
    revealed: [0],
});
```
